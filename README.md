# comp271-assignmentone
While copying codes from the priority queue, I had many errors or red lines. Additonally, I still need help with how to implement a test to finish part 3 of this project. Once I'm able to complete this I would be able to finish part 4 of the project, which I still feel I need help with. With that said, I used the Test directory to run the code I copied over anyway. It began with a few illegal start types and then a number of "class interface or enum expected errors."  I understand this is a compile-time error in Java due to curly braces and that the illegal start types are from misplaced braces. I seem to struggle from knowing where to start and stop certain code and when and where braces need to be. Seems like Comp170 stuff that just won't stick in my head.
