To help you understand why your code does not compile, I have taken some code
from `AssignmentOne.java` and pasted it into a new file called `MergeSortPriorityQueue.java`.
I have put a lengthy comment in that new file explaining why it compiles and why 
your version does not.  

I also added a test class, called `MergeSortPriorityQueueTest.java`.  You can use that as
an example for how to create a test harness.  You may notice that what I have done here
is very much like the class project that you copied this code from in the first place!

I suggest you follow that example and decompose what you've pasted into `AssignmentOne.java` into multiple files that compile.

In summary, you can't just paste a bunch of code into a file and expect it to work!  You
have to be more methodical.  Do one piece at a time, one line of code at a time, and
the compiler errors will make more sense.  

You can continue to work on this and resubmit for more credit anytime thru the end of
the term.  And I hope you do, because I truly believe that you will learn a lot
from making this work.
